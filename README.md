Making an Osmos like game using SFML in C++.

Laws of the Code
================

These are the laws of all the code that will go into this project. These were agreed upon by all the developers.

1. Document EVERY function that's not a getter or a setter.
2. No stupid continue crap. If you want to get an if/else statement inside a for loop, don't write if continue; code.
3. Don't use a cast unless you absolutely need one.
4. Curly braces go at the end of the line, not on the next line.
5. Use tabs for indentation.
6. All variables and functions will be capitalized as per SFML convention (UpperCamelCase).
7. Put all your #includes in header files.
8. DO NOT commit broken code to Master.
